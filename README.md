## What is it?

Welcome to the unofficial [Terraforming Mars](https://www.fryxgames.se/games/terraforming-mars/) digital Player Board 👋🏻

Where bumping resource markers, fuzzy maths calculations and lack of resource cubes are a thing of the past 😎

Easily keep track of resources and their production. Allocate resources in the Production Phase at the touch of a button.

Mobile-friendly ✅
Offline ✅
Undo/Redo functionality ✅
Lightning fast ✅
